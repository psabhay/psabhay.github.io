      <description>Hi, I am Abhay Pratap Singh. I find my name quite long so I prefer writing it as &amp;ldquo;Abhay PS&amp;rdquo;. I first started programming in the C language back in 1997, and since then my passion for programming has been increasing each day. Now I can write softwares in many programming languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, Javascript and Rust, but try to constrain myself to using Python only. In my early days, I was a full stack web developer for more than a decade and created web applications for a wide variety of clients.</description>
